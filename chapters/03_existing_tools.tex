\section{LLVMPin Instrumentation Framework}

\medskip

LLVMPin is a framework that simplifies implementing tools for LLVM IR
instrumentation. The framework basically consists of two scripts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{llvmpin-gen} runs the LLVMPin tool implemented by
          user and instruments a given code, 
    \item \texttt{llvmpin} generates a new
	  bitcode after instrumentation and from the bitcode it produces an
          executable.
\end{itemize}

The user has to provide a LLVMPin tool, which is a C++ code that must contain three
parts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{REQUIRE} routine with a list of existing LLVM
          passes\footnote{\url{http://llvm.org/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.html}} required by
          the LLVMPin tool,
    \item \texttt{INSTRUMENT} routine that inserts calls to analysis functions
          defined by user,
    \item analysis part that contains definitions of analysis functions and a
          routine for analysis setup.
\end{itemize}

The tool can use the LLVMPin API that currently offers some basic functions and
arguments, for example...

\textcolor{red}{TODO}

Although the LLVMPin framework is one of the tools for instrumentation that are
general and configurable, it does not simplify the work for the user in terms
of writing a code that controls the instrumentation process.
