In this chapter, we list tools that work with instrumentation of LLVM. In the
first section, we describe a framework for general instrumentation where the
user is somehow able to control the instrumentation in terms of what
instructions will be inserted, etc. In the second section, we list the tools
that use the instrumentation for specified purposes such as checking memory
safety.

\section{LLVMPin Instrumentation Framework}\label{sec:llvmpin}

\llvmpin~\cite{llvmpin} is a framework that simplifies implementing tools for
LLVM~IR instrumentation. First of all, a user has to implement an~LLVMPin tool,
which is a C++ code that must contain three parts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Analysis part that contains definitions of analysis functions and a
    routine for analysis setup. Analysis functions are functions that can be
    inserted into the given code to perform an analysis of the program.
    \item \texttt{INSTRUMENT} routine that inserts calls to analysis functions
    defined by user.
    \item \texttt{REQUIRE} routine with a list of existing LLVM
    passes\footnote{\url{http://llvm.org/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.html}} required
    by the LLVMPin tool.
\end{itemize}

The framework basically consists of two scripts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{llvmpin-gen} compiles the LLVMPin tool,
    \item \texttt{llvmpin} runs the instrumentation, gerates the new bitcode
    and from the bitcode it produces an executable.
\end{itemize}

The framework comes with the API that provides several functions and macros
that are useful for the instrumentation, for example a function
\texttt{INS\_InsertCall} that adds a call to an analysis function. However, a
user still has to implement the eintire \texttt{INSTRUMENT} routine to describe
how to instrument the code, including the procedure that searches for the
instructions that should be instrumented.

To summarize, the LLVMPin framework is one of a few instrumentation tools for
LLVM IR that are general and configurable, but it does not simplify the work
for the user in terms of writing a code that performs the core of the
instrumentation process.

\section{Other Tools}

In this section, we describe tools that are not designed for general
instrumentation but use instrumentation over LLVM for various purposes.

\textsc{Clang} compiler (licensed under University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source
License) provides several sanitizers that use instrumentation to insert runtime
checks for various errors and undefined behaviour. It offers a memory error
detection (out-of-bounds dereferences, use-after-free, double-free, etc.) with
\textsc{AddressSanitizer}~\cite{asan}, that instruments each memory access with
a check to a \textit{shadow memory}. The shadow memory contains metadata about
corresponding program memory, mainly \textit{poisoned redzones} that mark
locations of the memory that should not be accessed.
\textsc{ThreadSanitizer}~\cite{tsan} is used for detection of data races in
parallel programs. The analyzed code is instrumented such that it keeps
information about each memory access and checks whether the access takes part
in a race.  \textsc{UndefinedBehaviourSanitizer} offers undefined behaviour
detection (e.g. integer overflows) by instrumenting all operations that may
lead to undefined behaviour with a check. All these sanitizers modify the code
during compilation and insert run-time checks. Disadvantage is a slowdown and
memory overhead these tool introduce, however, the overhead introduced by other
tools that are designed for similar purposes is usually higher.

\textsc{SAFECode}~\cite{safecode} (Static Analysis For safe Execution of Code)
is a~tool developed at University of Illinois that checks memory safety, such
as accessing valid memory locations, out-of-bounds accesses, invalid frees and
detection of dangling pointers. Like Clang sanitizers it inserts run-time
checks at compile-time. Moreover, it uses static analysis to minimize the
number of inserted run-time checks.

Another tool that uses instrumentation to check memory safety is
\textsc{Map2Check}~\cite{map2check} (licensed under GNU General Public License
v2.0). It was inspired by \symbiotic and it inserts functions that track
allocated memory and operations on pointers with assertions that check whether
some property was violated in a similar way as we describe in~\ref{sec:basic}.
Moreover, it can also insert assertions that check integer overflows after
arithmetic operations. Currently, it does not use any static analysis to reduce
the number of inserted checks. Like \symbiotic, it uses \klee~\cite{klee} as
symbolic executor to check reachability of error locations.

\textsc{Loom} is an LLVM library for instrumentation that enables to insert
lines of code that expose values of LLVM instructions (e.g. return values of
function calls). The values are then written to a log or printed to the
standard output. In contrast to the above mentioned tools, it is in a sense
configurable. Users can specify what functions should be instrumented, whether
they should be instrumented on the caller site or the callee site, what
structures should be instrumented and whether they should be instrumented on
reads or writes, etc.

\textsc{LLVM IR Trace Profiler}~\cite{tracer} (\textsc{LLVM-Tracer}, licensed
under BSD 3-clause) is an LLVM pass that, like \textsc{Loom}, instruments the
given code to expose values. It traces dynamic register values as well as
memory addresses. The user can again specify what functions should be
instrumented. \todo{k cemu to je}
