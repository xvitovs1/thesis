\section{LLVMPin Instrumentation Framework}

\medskip

LLVMPin is a framework that simplifies implementing tools for LLVM~IR
instrumentation. The framework basically consists of two scripts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{llvmpin-gen} runs the LLVMPin tool implemented by
          user and instruments a given code, 
    \item \texttt{llvmpin} generates a new
	  bitcode after instrumentation and from the bitcode it produces an
          executable.
\end{itemize}

The user has to implement a LLVMPin tool, which is a C++ code that must contain three
parts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{REQUIRE} routine with a list of existing LLVM
          passes\footnote{\url{http://llvm.org/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.html}} required by
          the LLVMPin tool,
    \item \texttt{INSTRUMENT} routine that inserts calls to analysis functions
          defined by user,
    \item analysis part that contains definitions of analysis functions and a
          routine for analysis setup.
\end{itemize}

Although the LLVMPin framework is one of the instrumentation tools that are
general and configurable, it does not simplify the work for the user in terms
of writing a code that performs the core of the instrumentation process.
However, the framework provides the user with API that adds several functions
and macros that are useful for the instrumentation. For example, one of the
basic functions provided by the API is a function \texttt{INS\_InsertCall} that
adds a call to an analysis function.

Clang compiler provides several sanitizers that use instrumentation to insert runtime checks for various errors and undefined behaviour.

Disadvantage: runtime checks?
