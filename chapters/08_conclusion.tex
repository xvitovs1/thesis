Within this thesis, we listed tools that perform instrumentation of LLVM~IR. We
designed and implemented a new tool for general instrumentation of LLVM IR such
that it can be easily configured with two files provided by a user. Moreover,
the tool can use results of static analyzers to reduce the amount of the
inserted code.

We also created a~configuration for this tool that is aimed at checking memory
safety of programs. We improved this configuration with two enhancements:
(i)~we employed a~pointer analysis to find out if it can itself decide
whether a pointer dereference is valid, and (ii)~we divided the instrumentation
into stages to omit some of the memory allocations from the instrumentation.
Both of these enhancements led to a smaller amount of inserted code and
therefore to a~faster analysis of the code.

Finally, we evaluated the configurations for checking memory safety by
employing the instrumentation in the tool \symbiotic and running it on a set of
benchmarks from SV-COMP. The enhanced configurations proved to be of great
benefit as \symbiotic won the first place in category \emph{MemSafety}
in SV-COMP~2018.
