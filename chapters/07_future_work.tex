In the future, we would like to implement a few more features to our
instrumentation tool. First of all, we would like to enable not only insertion
of instructions, but also their replacement. For example, a user may want to
replace calls of a built-in function (e.g.~malloc) with calls of a function
with the same semantics but different implementation enriched with some
analysis functionality.

Another feature we would like to implement is the possibility to determine
what plugin should be questioned when evaluating a query. The queries are often
intended for a concrete plugin and it is therefore pointless to question all
plugins at once.

Apart from the tool itself, we would also like to come up with a new
configuration files for \symbiotic. Currently, we use \clang to check for
integer overflows in programs, but in the future, we want to create our own
configuration for the instrumentation to check for the overflows. This would
also lead to an implementation of a value analysis that would be used as a
plugin to reduce the number of inserted checks.  As for memory safety
configuration, we consider replacing the lists for preserving records with more
efficient structure, such as trees.
