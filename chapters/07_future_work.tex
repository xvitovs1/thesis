In the future, we would like to implement a few more features to our
instrumentation tool. First of all, we would like to enable not only insertion
of instructions, but also their replacement. This might seem a little bit
inconvenient at first sight, since the instrumentation is not supposed to
modify the given input program, however, a user might for example want to
replace calls of a function with calls of a function with the same semantics
but different implementation enriched with some analysis functionality, e.g.
logging.

Another improvement we would like to implement is the insertion of more kinds of
instructions. As we mentioned earlier, inserting only \texttt{call}
instructions is sufficient, but we would like the tool to be as general as
possible.

Apart from the tool itself, we would also like to come up with new
configuration files for \symbiotic. Currently, we use \clang to check for
integer overflows in programs, but in the future, we want to create our own
configuration for the instrumentation to check for the overflows. This would
also lead to an implementation of a value analysis that would be used as a plugin.
As for memory safety configuration, we want to try replacing the lists for
preserving records with more efficient structure, such as trees.
