In this chapter, we describe the configuration of instrumentation for checking
memory safety. The configuration was created in order to enable checking memory
safety with \symbiotic. Nevertheless, the final code can be executed and used for other
purposes.

\section{Basic Approach}\label{sec:basic}

To check memory safety, namely absence of invalid pointer dereferences, invalid
deallocations, and memory leaks, our instrumentation inserts a code that tracks
all allocated memory blocks and all memory-manipulating operations at run-time.
For every block of the memory, we maintain a record with the address and the size
of the block. The records are stored in four lists:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \stacklist for blocks allocated on the stack
  \item \heaplist for blocks allocated on the heap
  \item \globalslist for global variables
  \item \dealloclist for blocks on the heap that were already deallocated
\end{itemize}
We keep the records in the last list only to provide more precise
error descriptions. For example, the information in this list allows
us to distinguish double free error from generic invalid deallocation,
or use-after-free from vague invalid dereference error. This list can
be removed in order to reduce memory consumption.

To maintain the records, we use the following functions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_remember(address, type\_size, num\_of\_fields)}
  \\Creates a record and inserts it to the \stacklist.
  \item \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_remember\_malloc(address, size)}
  \\Creates a record and inserts it to the \heaplist. If the address is equal
  to 0 (i.e. the NULL address), no record is stored.
  \item \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_remember\_global(address, size)}
  \\Creates a record and inserts it to the \globalslist.
  \item \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_free(address)}
  \\Checks whether the address refers to some block allocated on the heap,
  i.e., whether there is a record with this address in the \heaplist. If such a
  record exists, it is removed from the \heaplist and inserted into the
  \dealloclist. If there is a~record for this address, but it is found in the
  \dealloclist, we report double free error. If the address is equal to 0 (i.e.
  the NULL address), nothing happens. In all remaining cases, an invalid
  deallocation is reported.
  \item \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_realloc(old\_address, new\_address, size)} \\Removes
  the old record for the \texttt{old\_address} from the \heaplist and inserts a
  new record to the \heaplist. If the \texttt{old\_address} is equal to 0
  (i.e. the NULL address), only the new record is created. If the
  \texttt{new\_address} is equal to 0, nothing happens.
  \item \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_destroy\_allocas()}
  \\ Since local variables on the stack are destroyed when a function
  finishes, this function removes all relevant records from the \stacklist right
  before returning from the function.
  \item \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_set\_flag()}
  \\ When entering a function, it sets a flag in the \stacklist to mark the
  point to which extent the records in this list should be removed when
  \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_destroy\_allocas()} is called.
\end{itemize}

There are also three more functions that use records to check
the safety of memory operations, but they do not modify them:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_check\_pointer(address, n)}
  \\Checks whether it is a safe operation to dereference $n$ bytes starting at
  the given address. More precisely, it checks whether there is a record in the
  \stacklist, \heaplist or the \globalslist covering $n$ bytes starting at the
  given address.  If such a record is found, the check is successful. If the
  address is covered by a~record stored in the \dealloclist, we report a
  use-after-free error If no record covering the address is found, or there is
  a record covering the address but not all $n$ bytes starting at this address,
  we report an invalid dereference.
\item \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_check\_realloc(address)}
  \\ Checks whether
  \emph{realloc} is called on a valid pointer. More precisely, if the record for
  the given address is not found in the \heaplist, we report an
  error.
% \todo{NENI PRAVDA: When dereferencing a single address, we use 1 as the
% second parameter. A larger parameter is used for instrumentation of
% functions like \texttt{memset} or \texttt{memcpy}}
\item \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_check\_leaks()}
  \\Checks whether all blocks that were dynamically allocated on the heap have been
  freed. In other words, if there is a record in the \heaplist, then we report
  a memory leak.
\end{itemize}

The checks mentioned in the functions above
% , namely in \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_free(address)},
% \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_check\_pointer(address, n)}, and
% \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_check\_leaks()},
are in fact implemented as assertions. Hence, an error is reported if
and only if some of these asserts can be violated, i.e.~if an error
location is reachable.

Calls to the hitherto described functions are inserted into the analyzed
program to keep track of the state of the memory. For each global variable, the
instrumentation inserts an \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_remember\_global} call to the
beginning of \emph{main} in order to create the corresponding record. Further,
the instrumentation detects memory handling instructions in the code and
inserts calls to the corresponding \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_*} functions above or
below these instructions. When instrumenting a memory allocation instruction
(e.g. \texttt{alloca}), we insert the call of \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_remember}
function (for allocations on the stack), the call of
\texttt{\_\_INSTR\_remember\_malloc} function (for allocations on the heap) and
the call of \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_realloc} (for reallocations) \emph{below} the
allocation instruction as the called function needs the address of the
allocated block. In all remaining cases, the calls are inserted \emph{above}
the corresponding instruction as we want to detect a memory handling error
before the program reaches the actual error. \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_set\_flag}
calls  are instrumented at the beginnings of all functions and calls of
\texttt{\_\_INSTR\_destroy\_allocas} are instrumented \emph{above} all return
instructions in each function. Finally, a call to
\texttt{\_\_INSTR\_check\_leaks} is inserted at the end of \emph{main} to
check for memory leaks.

\caption{Basic instrumentation of a code with an invalid pointer
  dereference.}
\label{fig:example1}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:example1} shows a simple code containing an invalid
pointer dereference. The instrumentation
remembers every memory allocation, including stack variables (lines~3 and~5). It may
seem redundant at first, but without any further analysis, we can not
say that a local variable is dereferenced e.g.~using a pointer, in
which case we need to have the record, otherwise we would report
invalid dereference.
%(in particular, dereference of non-allocated memory).
The memory allocated by the call to \texttt{malloc} is
later freed and this fact is recorded by the \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_free(i8* \%6)}
call. Every access to the memory (every \texttt{load} or \texttt{store}
instruction) are checked using \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_check\_pointer}. The last
call of this function (line~17) reveals use-after-free error. We can also
see that apart from the  calls to bitcasts were inserted to convert actual types
to the types required by \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_*} functions.

%\texttt{\_\_INSTR\_free(p)} moves the record from \heaplist to \dealloclist.
%Finally, the code is instrumented with a call to
%\texttt{\_\_INSTR\_check\_pointer(r, 4)} which detects the use-after-free
%error.

\begin{figure}[t]
\lstinputlisting{examples/setflag.ll}
\caption{Instrumentation of a function that returns a local object.}
\label{fig:examplesetflags}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:examplesetflags}, we demonstrate a code where
\texttt{\_\_INSTR\_set\_flag} and \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_destroy\_allocas}
functions are necessary. The function \texttt{getArray} allocates an array of
ten integers and returns a pointer to this array. The array was allocated on
the stack which means its lifetime ends at the end of the function. However,
the record was stored to the \stacklist on line 5. If the functions
\texttt{\_\_INSTR\_set\_flag} and \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_destroy\_allocas} were not
called, a check of any dereference of the returned pointer would find the
record for corresponding memory block in the \stacklist and the error would not
be discovered. If these two functions are called, all records in the \stacklist
up to the record with the flag set by the call on line 2 (that is, all records
for local variables from the current function) are destroyed at the end of the
function \texttt{getArray} on line 8. In this case, the
returned pointer would no longer be present in the \stacklist and an
invalid pointer dereference would be reported.

Disadvantage of this basic approach is that it tracks all memory allocations and
instruments all dereferences. The amount of inserted function calls is
therefore usually very large and since the vast majority of the new code has
an effect on reachability of error locations, it cannot be removed by slicing.

\label{fig:example2}
\end{figure}


Blindly instrumenting every manipulation with memory brings a big
overhead in the reachability analysis because of the number of added
calls that track or check the state of memory. This problem can be
mitigated using pointer analysis as a plugin.

For every pointer in the program, pointer analysis answers the
question "What memory locations may be referenced by the pointer?"
Thus the result of pointer analysis is a set of memory locations (the
so-called points-to set) for every pointer. For the sake of
soundness, a~points-to set can possibly contain the \emph{unknown}
entry where the analysis can not establish any information about
referenced memory locations. The precision of pointer analysis can be
tuned in several directions. One of the important traits of pointer
analysis is whether it is \emph{flow-sensitive} or
\emph{flow-insensitive}~\cite{Hind01}, meaning whether it takes into
consideration the flow of data in the program and computes points-to
sets for every location in the program separately (flow-sensitive), or
whether it ignores the execution order of instructions and computes
summary information about a pointer that holds at any location in the
program (flow-insensitive). For instance, in
Figure~\ref{fig:example2} a flow-insensitive analysis would tell us
that \emph{r} may point to either NULL or \emph{p} anywhere in the
program. The flow-sensitive analysis can give us information that
until the \texttt{r = p;} assignment is performed, \emph{r} points to
\texttt{NULL} and after that it points to \emph{p}.
 
With information from pointer analysis, we can say which memory may be
dereferenced in many cases. If every possible memory dereference done
by an instruction is safe, we do not need to insert the check for
invalid dereference above this instruction. For example, in
Figure~\ref{fig:example2} the assignments to variables \emph{p} and
\emph{r} can be proved to be always safe and thus need not to be
instrumented with a check. Nevertheless, typical pointer analyses do
not take into account information whether the memory was freed or
whether the lifetime of a~local variable has ended because of the end
of its scope.  This would cause problems in our approach in cases like
the one in Figure~\ref{fig:example2} where the assignment \texttt{*r =
  1} dereferences already freed memory.  Without information about
invalidated memory, pointer analysis tells us that the assignment
dereferences the memory allocated by the call to \texttt{malloc(4)}
and thus writing 4 bytes to that memory is a safe operation.
Instrumentation would incorrectly omit the check in this case.

We extended a simple flow-sensitive
Andersen's style~\cite{and94} pointer analysis so that it can track
whether a memory block was possibly invalidated (i.e.~it was freed or
its lifetime ended).  This \emph{extended pointer analysis} must be
flow-sensitive in order to get reasonable results, as flow-insensitive
analysis would mark all memory blocks that were freed somewhere in the
program as possibly invalidated (freed).

\begin{figure}[t]
\lstinputlisting{examples/pointsto.ll}
\caption{Instrumentation of a code with an invalid pointer
  dereference extended with a pointer analysis.}
\label{fig:examplepta}
\end{figure}

% The predicate that is of a great importance for checking memory
% safety is \emph{mayBeInvalidPointer(addr, len)}.
For checking memory safety, we use the \texttt{isValidPointer(addr, len)} query
with expected result \emph{``false''} or \emph{``maybe''}. Satisfiability of this
condition is determined through the extended pointer analysis, which returns
the expected results if dereferencing \texttt{len} bytes starting from the
address given in \texttt{addr} argument may be unsafe or when the analysis does
not have enough information to refute the validity of the predicate.  The
reader could notice that we do not pass the location in the program to the
predicate even though we claimed that the extended pointer analysis is
flow-sensitive. This is because LLVM SSA form, so the pointer analysis
can infer the location from the \texttt{addr} variable.
%\todo{Here we use that fact that LLVM is in partial-SSA, otherwise we must pass also location
%in the program to that predicate...}

We added the condition \texttt{isValidPointer(addr, len)} with expected results
\emph{``false''} or \emph{``maybe''} to every rule that instruments reading or
writing from/to memory (where \texttt{addr} is the address used to access the
memory and \texttt{len} is the number of read/written bytes). In
Figure~\ref{fig:examplepta}, an array of ten integers is allocated on line 1
and the pointer is stored to the \stacklist on line 3.  When the
instrumentation tries to instrument the \texttt{store} instruction on line 6,
the pointer analysis replies \emph{"true"} to the query
\texttt{isValidPointer(\%3, 4)}, as it knows that the dereference is always
safe. Therefore, this \texttt{store} is not instrumented. However, when
checking this query for the \texttt{store} instruction on line 11, the extended
pointer analysis returns \emph{"false"}, as \texttt{\%4} tries to access the
twentieth element of the array of length 10. A check hence needs to be inserted
above this \texttt{store} instruction.

\section{Extension with Staged Instrumentation}\label{sec:staged}
% \begin{figure}[t]
% 	\begin{lstlisting}
%     int array[10];

% \end{figure}
%
Although the pointer analysis helps us to eliminate checks of safe
dereferences, the approach still tracks all memory allocations.
Now, there can be no corresponding checks for many of the remembered records.
Keeping such records is useless as we will never try to look them up in any of the lists.
Moreover, if fewer records are stored, the whole verification process is faster
because smaller lists are searched.
% Figure~\ref{fig:no_check_example} shows a
% scenario where the allocation of \texttt{array} is instrumented with a call to
% \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_remember} even though pointer analysis evaluated the only
% dereference of \texttt{array} as safe and no check was inserted. In this case,
% we do not need to remember the record since the information will not be used
% anywhere.

\lstset{escapeinside={<@}{@>}, columns=fullflexible, basicstyle=\ttfamily, language=llvm, style=nasm}
\begin{figure}[t]
\lstinputlisting{examples/noremember.ll}
\caption{Instrumentation of a code where no checks are inserted and \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_remember*} function calls are therefore redundant.}
\label{fig:exampleNoRemember}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:exampleNoRemember} shows a scenario where the allocations on
line 7 and 10 are instrumented with \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_remember} even though
pointer analysis evaluated all dereferences that could point to these variables
as safe and no check was inserted. We thus do not need to remember the records
since they will not be used anywhere (but they will redundantly prolong the
list of records). The same holds for the global variable
\texttt{globalInteger}.

The problem with instrumenting redundant calls to functions
\texttt{\_\_INSTR\_remember*} can be solved by dividing the instrumentation
into two phases:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item instrumentation of \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_check\_*} calls
  \item instrumentation of \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_remember*} calls
\end{enumerate}

In the first phase, \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_check\_*} calls are inserted
according to results of the pointer analysis as described in
Section~\ref{sec:pta}. Additionally, the instrumentation remembers all memory
locations that may have been dereferenced by any instrumented instruction in an
auxiliary list by setting the field \texttt{remember} in corresponding rules.

In the second phase, we insert \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_remember*} calls. For every
memory allocation, we first check whether the underlying memory location has
been remembered in the first phase with the query
\texttt{isRemembered(memory\_location)}. If it
has, we create a record for this allocation because a check that can use this
record was inserted in the first stage. Otherwise, this memory allocation is
not instrumented.

The only exception are memory allocations on the heap. As we need to
create these records always due to the check for memory leaks at the
end of \emph{main}, we insert calls to
\texttt{\_\_INSTR\_remember\_malloc} function unconditionally in the
first phase.  Nevertheless, the staged instrumentation can improve
also on memory leaks checking. If some dynamic memory allocation is
instrumented with \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_remember\_malloc} in the first
phase, the \texttt{malloc-present} flag is set to \emph{true}.  In
the second stage, \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_check\_leaks} is instrumented
only under the condition that the \texttt{malloc\_present} flag was
set to \emph{true}. Therefore, we can avoid leaks checking in programs
that do not use dynamic memory allocation.

\subsection{Extension With Constant-Time Checks}\label{sec:constant_time}

\lstset{escapeinside={<@}{@>}, columns=fullflexible, basicstyle=\ttfamily, language=llvm, style=nasm}
\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{lstlisting}
%1 = alloca [10 x i32]
%m = call i64 @input()
%2 = getelementptr inbounds [10 x i32],
       [10 x i32]* %1, i64 0, i64 %m
<@{\color[RGB]{0, 135,0} \%3 = bitcast [10 x i32]* \%1 to i8*}@>

store i32 1, i32* %2
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Instrumentation of a code with \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_check\_bounds}.}
\label{fig:check_bounds_example}
\end{figure}

 Let us assume that there is an instruction that may possibly
perform an unsafe dereference (i.e.~the answer to \texttt{isValidPointer}
query was \emph{``false''} or \emph{``maybe''} and thus a check has to be
inserted). In some cases, we can statically find the address and the size of
the memory block that is being dereferenced and therefore we do not need to
look for the corresponding record in the list during run-time. The cases where
we can do this must meet these conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item the pointer analysis must give us a single memory location where the
dereferenced pointer must point
\item the memory location is not \emph{unknown}, NULL nor invalidated
\item the size of this memory location is constant
\end{itemize}

We query the pointer analysis with \texttt{hasKnownSize(memory\_block)}
to get this information.  If the answer is \emph{``false''} or \emph{``maybe''},
the dereference must be instrumented with the usual
\texttt{\_\_INSTR\_check\_pointer}. Otherwise, a call to a
\texttt{\_\_INSTR\_check\_bounds} function is to be inserted.
\texttt{\_\_INSTR\_check\_bounds} function takes four arguments: the address
and the size of the dereferenced memory block (provided by the pointer analysis
through \texttt{getPointerInfo} field in a JSON configuration file as
described in~\ref{sec:config}), the pointer that is being dereferenced, and
the number of dereferenced bytes.  This information is sufficient to decide
whether an out-of-bound error occurs.  The last requirement demands that the
size of the memory location is constant, thus known at the compile time (and,
consequently, known by the pointer analysis).  This is to avoid the cases where
the size parameter used when allocating the memory may change between the
allocation and the inserted checks.  There are definitely cases where this
optimized instrumentation could be used with variable size parameter too, but
they are a subject of further research.

An example of instrumentation with constant-time checks can be found in
Figure~\ref{fig:check_bounds_example}. On line 6 where the array of ten
integers allocated on line 1 is being dereferenced by \texttt{store}
instruction, the pointer analysis can determine the address and the size of the
array precisely, hence the call to \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_check\_bounds} is
inserted instead of the usual call to \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_check\_pointer}.

This extension is not dependent on the staged
instrumentation. Nevertheless, since the \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_check\_bounds}
function does not use records, no memory locations need to be remembered
because of this check (unlike when using \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_check\_pointer}),
and the second phase of instrumentation may be able to insert fewer calls to
\texttt{\_\_INSTR\_remember} when this extension is used (as can be seen also
in Figure~\ref{fig:check_bounds_example} where no call to
\texttt{\_\_INSTR\_remember} was inserted below the \texttt{alloca}
instruction).

Inserting fewer calls to \texttt{\_\_INSTR\_remember} function has a positive
effect on the speed of reachability analysis (or running the program) since the
lists used to keep records are shorter. All the described extensions together
can significantly reduce the number of instrumented instructions which have
also a positive effect on the portion of code possibly removed by slicing
before the reachability analysis in \symbiotic.
