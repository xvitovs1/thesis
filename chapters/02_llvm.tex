LLVM is an open source project that provides compiler technologies designed to
be independent of target architecture. It uses LLVM IR as an intermediate
representation code. It can be used in three different forms: human readable
representation, bitcode representation and an in-memory compiler IR. From this
point we will take only the human readable form into consideration.

\section{LLVM IR structure} %TODO rename the chapter to LLVM IR?

LLVM IR is in SSA form (static single assignment form), which means that each
variable can be assigned only once and must be defined before its use. It uses
global identifiers that begin with the '@' character for functions and global
variables and local identifiers that begin with the '\%' character for register
names and types. Both kinds of identifiers can be named or unnamed, unnamed
identifiers are represented as an unsigned numeric values. 

\textcolor{red}{TODO example?}

The high-level structure of an LLVM IR program consists of modules, which are
units \textcolor{red}{TODO}. Modules are composed of global variables and
functions.

\section{LLVM IR types}

LLVM IR is a strongly typed language.
